# 2024 BJFU Database Course Design -- Tutor-Student Two-Way Selection System

## Introduction

The overall goal of this course design is to design a two-way selection system for tutors and students based on SQL database, providing business functions for three roles: candidates, tutors, and administrators. The candidate-side business line includes viewing personal information and enrollment plans, volunteer registration, score query, and admission status query, helping candidates understand admission information and complete the volunteer application process. The tutor-side business line focuses on the screening of candidates' volunteer information and scores, and provides tutors with suitable student choices through a multi-level matching mechanism. The administrator-side business line is responsible for global management, configuring enrollment plans, monitoring the selection process of tutors and students, and managing system activity logs.

The system builds multiple core table structures, fully designs and implements the persistence layer, and uses the signal mechanism to automatically generate system role associations to ensure data consistency and security. In addition, the system integrates multiple security controls such as verification codes and role permission control in login verification to ensure data access security.
